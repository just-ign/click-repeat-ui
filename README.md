# Click Repeat

A desktop automation tool built with Electron, React, TypeScript, and Shadcn UI that allows you to record and replay UI workflows.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¥ **Record UI Interactions** - Capture mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard actions
- ðŸ¤– **Automated Replay** - Run saved workflows with a single click
- ðŸ“± **Minimal Interface** - Unobtrusive floating window that stays out of your way
- ðŸŽ¨ **Modern UI** - Beautiful, accessible interface built with Shadcn UI components
- ðŸŒ™ **Dark mode support** - Automatically adapts to system preferences

## How It Works

1. **Record** - Click the "Record" button to start capturing your screen interactions
2. **Process** - Recordings are automatically processed into reusable workflows
3. **Replay** - Click the "Play" button to select and execute any saved workflow

The app intelligently scales coordinates between different screen resolutions, making workflows portable across different devices.
